\section*{Problem Statement}

We observe a bit sequence $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots \in \{0,1\}.$ We generate a sequence of predictions 
\(
p_1, p_2, \ldots \in [0,1]
\)
and would like to minimize the cumulative loss 
\[
L_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \bigl| p_t - Y_t \bigr|.
\]

We consider two scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We assume that the sequence is generated by i.i.d.\ coin flips where 
    \[
    P(Y_t = 1) \;=\; q, \quad \text{with } q \text{ unknown}.
    \]
    
    \item We do not assume anything about how the sequence is generated. We want the cumulative loss to
    not be much larger than the cumulative loss of the best (in hindsight) fixed prediction $h \in [0,1]$.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission}
Please submit a single compiled PDF with your solutions to Gradescope on or before \textbf{January 21}.
