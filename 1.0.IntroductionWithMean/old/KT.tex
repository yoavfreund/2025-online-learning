\frametitle{Estimating the bias of a coin}

\begin{itemize}
\item We observe $n$ coin flips:\\
{\bf H,T,T,H,H,T,H,T,T}
\item
We want to estimate the {\bf probability} that the next flip will be {\bf H}ead.
\item
Natural Answer:
\[
\frac{\#\mbox{\bf H}}{n} = \frac{4}{9}
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What if the estimation has to be done online?}

\begin{itemize}
\item We observe a {bf sequence} of coin flips, and have to predict the probability of {\bf H}ead at each step:
\\ $p_0$,\pause 
{\bf H},\pause 
$p_1$,\pause
{\bf T},\pause
$p_2$,\pause 
$\ldots$
\item
What would be a good value for $p_0$?
\item
For $p_1$?
\item
Laplace Law of succession
\[
\frac{\#\mbox{\bf H} +1}{n+2}
\]
\item 
Turns out that a better rule is 
\[
\frac{\#\mbox{\bf H} +1/2}{n+1}
\]
Krichevsky and Trofimov, 1981
\item
Why? 
\item 
What does ``better'' mean?
